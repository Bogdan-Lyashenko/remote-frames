# @klarna/unicorn-remote-frames

Render a subset of the React tree to a different location, from many locations, without having to coordinate them.

## TODO

- [ ] Make it aware of Context (both in UnicornRemoteFramesProvider and UnicornRemoteFrame level)
- [ ] Make UnicornRemoteFrame able to render locally if the UnicornRemoteFramesProvider is not set

## Usage

```js
import {
  UnicornRemoteFrame,
  UnicornRemoteFramesProvider
} from '@klarna/unicorn-remote-frames'
```
